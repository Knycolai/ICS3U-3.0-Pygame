# IMPORTING LIBRARIES
# This enables the Pygame library function in your Python program.
# Necessary for all Pygame programs. Do not change this line.
import pygame
import sys

# INITIALIZE PYGAME
# Necessary for all Pygame programs. Do not change this line.
pygame.init()

# SET UP DISPLAY AREA
# This sets up the Pygame window that opens when you run the program. You can 
# modify the size of the window as well as its caption.
width, height = 600, 400                    # CHANGE THIS LINE FOR SIZE
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))

# COLOUR NAME DEFINITIONS
# Define easy-to-remember names for colours. Note these variable names are in 
# ALL CAPS, denoting CONSTANTS that will not change throughout the program.
#
# Define colours manually using RGB values from https://rgbcolorpicker.com/
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

# Pygame is essentially a continuous loop that redraws the screen graphics
# contents over and over again until some condition causes it to quit.
# The `running` variable and `while` loop sets this up.

    # EVENT HANDLER
    # This section determines when to stop Pygame. In our case, the
    # only condition to end the program is when the user closes the
    # Pygame graphics window. When the user closes the window, this
    # sets the `running` variable to `False` and stop Pygame.
    # Do not remove this section.

    # customize this section as much as you'd like.
